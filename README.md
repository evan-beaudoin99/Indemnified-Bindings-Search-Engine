# Indemnified-Bindings-Search-Engine


## Description:   
This is a PHP and MySQL server which stores ski bindings in a relational database. It uses a live search box feature to quicky and efficiently search for bindings in a database rather than do a manual paper lookup. This is meant to be a quick and easy solution at my work (ski shop in Ottawa) where we have to manually look through an unorganized, crumpled, and faded peice of paper full of "indemnified bindings". As a sales associate or technician, it is your job to ensure that we only service bindings that are indemnfied or insured by retailers. This is a huge deal as expired bandings can be dangerous, and the company would be held liable if we mistakenly serviced a binding that is no longer indemnified. As with everything, humans make emistakes, the store gets busy and skis slip through into the back shop where they either get worked on, deeming the company liable or the technician halts the service leaving a dissapointed customer and bad review (wasting his/hers time). The goal here was to setup a lightweight SQL database that stores all of the indemnified binding models as well as a PHP web app to effectively streamline the process of 'manual lookup' thus avoiding human error.
